Please help resolve this merge conflict:

```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
def calculate_metrics(data):
    """Calculate basic user engagement metrics"""
    return {
        'active_users': len(data),
        'total_actions': sum(data['actions'])
    }
=======
def calculate_metrics(data, include_advanced=False):
    """Calculate user engagement metrics with optional advanced stats"""
    metrics = {
        'active_users': len(data),
        'total_actions': sum(data['actions']),
        'engagement_rate': sum(data['actions'])/len(data)
    }
>>>>>>> feature/advanced-metrics
```

### Conflict context:
* File: metrics_calculator.py
* Purpose: Core metrics calculation
* Current branch: main
* Merging from: feature/advanced-metrics
* Project stage: development

### Code details:
