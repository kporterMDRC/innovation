## Example

````
Please help debug this error:

```
Error in select():
! Problem while computing `ratio = value/group_total`.
Caused by error in `/`:
! non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

### Code causing error:
```r
data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  mutate(ratio = value/sum(value))
```

### Reproducible example:
```r
# Sample data
data <- tibble(
  category = c("A", "B", "A"),
  value = c("10", "20", "30")  # Note: character
)

# Steps to reproduce
library(dplyr)
data %>%
  group_by(category) %>%
  mutate(ratio = value/sum(value))
```

### Environment details:
* R version: 4.2.0
* Operating System: Windows 10
* Key packages:
    - dplyr: 1.1.0
    - tidyverse: 2.0.0

### Additional context:
* Goal: Calculate ratio within groups
* When error occurs: Consistently
* What I've tried: 
    - Checked data types
    - Printed intermediate results
* Recent changes: Data import method

### Special considerations:
* Data size: Small example
* Memory usage: Not applicable
* Performance: Not applicable
* Dependencies: Core tidyverse only
