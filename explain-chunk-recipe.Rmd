# Explain What a Code Chunk is Doing {#explain-chunk}

## Ingredients

* Code chunk to explain
* Context information
* Programming background
* Specific questions
* Package versions

## Instructions

Use this prompt template:

````
Please explain what this code chunk does:

```r
[paste code here]
```

### Context:
* Location: [where in script/program]
* Purpose: [what it should do]
* Input data:
    - Structure: [data format]
    - Example: [sample data]
* Output: [expected result]

### My background:
* R experience: [beginner/intermediate/advanced]
* Familiar with: [concepts you know]
* Unclear about: [confusing parts]
* Package experience: [relevant packages]

### Specific questions:
* [list parts needing explanation]
* [list concepts to clarify]
* [note practical applications]
* [ask about alternatives]

### Additional information:
* Performance concerns: [if any]
* Error handling: [if relevant]
* Style questions: [if any]
* Alternative approaches: [if interested]

## Tips

* Show context
* Identify patterns
* Note dependencies
* Consider alternatives
* Check documentation
* Test assumptions
* Verify output
* Explain flow

## Serves

* Code review
* Learning
* Documentation
* Troubleshooting
* Optimization
* Refactoring
* Knowledge sharing

## Example

````
Please explain what this code chunk does:

```r
results <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(across(
    where(is.numeric),
    list(
      avg = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE),
      sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE)
    ),
    .names = "{.col}_{.fn}"
  )) %>%
  arrange(desc(cyl))
```

### Context:
* Location: Data analysis script
* Purpose: Calculate summary statistics
* Input data:
    - Structure: mtcars dataset
    - Example: head(mtcars, 2)
* Output: Summary by cylinder groups

### My background:
* R experience: intermediate
* Familiar with: dplyr basics, group_by
* Unclear about: across(), where()
* Package experience: tidyverse

### Specific questions:
* How does across() work with where()?
* What does the .names parameter do?
* Why use ~ in the list?
* Is there a simpler way?

### Additional information:
* Performance concerns: None
* Error handling: NA handling
* Style questions: Alternative syntax
* Alternative approaches: Base R version
